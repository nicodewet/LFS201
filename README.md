Having completed the _Essentials of Linux System Administration (LFS201)_ course, these are the exercises completed before sitting the actual LFCS exam.

## Setup

As per the Vagrantfile first install these to get a virtual local Ubuntu Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS:

* vagrant
* virtualbox

Then _vagrant up_, _vagrant ssh_, _cd vagrant_ and let's crack on.

## Cracking On

### Essential Commands

Count the number of lines in lorem.txt

```
/vagrant$ wc -l lorem.txt
